// My character and background design was inspired from a 2D platformer I have played called "Hollow Knight." Both the character and background are dark and desaturated colors, creating a gloomy environment for the game. 
// I also gave the player a distinct black outline to differienciate from the smooth lines in the background. 
// The sprites were created in Piskel and exported/imported into Unity as JPEGs. No challenges occurred in which during the sprite importing or making process.
